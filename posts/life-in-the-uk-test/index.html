	<h1>An experience on the Life in the UK Test</h1>
	<div class="post-content"><h2 id="general-feelings">General feelings</h2>
<p>So I have passed the <strong>Life in the UK Test</strong>. To be fair, it is quite simple; I have prepared for the worse.
I was not told what my score was, but I was certain about 20 of the 24 questions, with some educated
guesses for the rest.</p>
<p>People (my solicitor especially) are saying that even native Britons wont be able to pass the Life
in the UK Test without preparation, which I kinda of agree. After all, who on earth would try to remember
 <em>where did Herry III&#39;s fifth wife come from?</em>, apart from <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006z736">egghead</a>?
But with some time study, it is fairly simple. The <strong>40 minutes test</strong> took me 15 minutes to finish with double check,
and hesitating whether to do a triple check to make the <strong>£50 test fee</strong> more worthwhile.</p>
<h2 id="take-the-test">Take the test</h2>
<p>Before the test, the supervisors would question about my name, DOB, etc., to make sure I know myself well enough.
Then I was lead to a quite old computer with some crappy mouse; I have to fiddle with it to make sure
it won&#39;t click incorrectly on the screen. One funny fact is, to be able to administrate the test,
it requires <strong>TWO</strong> supervisors&#39; input of their passwords, in turn, to satisfy the security check, very much reminding me
of some movie, in which more than one passwords from different persons are required to lunch the nuclear missile.</p>
<p>After the supervisor double checked again with my ID, my test session started. Before the real test, I was able to practise
with a few questions to get familiar with the interface (and the mouse), then off me went, submitted 15 minutes later.
Then I realised that I cannot leave until everyone else finished as well<i class="fa fa-frown-o"> </i>.
What a reckless decision that was.</p>
<p>Finally, other test mates were encouraged by my spirit and submitted. Then each one was called up to be told if they passed or not.
Failed ones went home empty hand; passed ones with a certificate and a happy face.</p>
<h2 id="don-t-lower-your-guard">Don&#39;t lower your guard</h2>
<p>It wasn&#39;t particular busy day in the test center, with only a handful of people taking the test.
One of my test mates, a 20-ish west asian boy, failed his second attempt. When chatted
with him afterward, he kept saying that his british mate knew nothing about the questions,
as if to prove that he failed with a good reason. Well, you are not british, just yet. This
is the exactly reason why I developed <a href="http://www.mockthetest.com">Mock the Test</a> website to help.
Try a <a href="http://www.mockthetest.com/#test">test</a> for yourself, see if it is easy enough for you to pass.</p>
